    <p>This site might be down due to technical issues or maintenance.</p>

    <p>Our small data center is currently operating with limited air-conditioning. Due to this, most of our servers have been shut down to avoid data loss from the overheating of the data center. We are waiting on the procurement of the
    maintenance contract for our air-conditioning units to be cleaned and repaired and this might take some time.</p> 

    <p>If you have reached this page, while in the search for LiDAR data and derived data-sets such as agricultural, coastal, forestry, and hydrological resource maps, please feel free to e-mail us at lipad@dream.upd.edu.ph. Our volunteers who are former researchers under the UP DREAM/PHIL-LiDAR Program will try to look for the data your are requesting for.</p>

    <p>We apologize for the inconvenience and we thank you for your patience and understanding.</p>
